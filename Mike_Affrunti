#Firstly, I learned what a repository is, as well as they many ways to divvy up your data on github using things like branches and forks. I also learned that there
#are varying degrees of how public your work is. After I commit this file in our repository, I plan to familiarize myself with my profile, and write my
#own readme. I also plan to write some code inside of github and run it. I want to try both uploading files from previous assignments, and working directly
#in github. I haven't found much to be confused by yet in Github, but I will revise this markdown file as I come across these things so I can track
#my own development and understanding.
